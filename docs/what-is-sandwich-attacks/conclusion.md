# Conclusion

Sandwich attacks are not just a technical issue; they are directly tied to DeFi’s credibility and sustainable growth. If left unaddressed, users will continue to suffer unexpected losses and opaque execution costs, and many will leave DeFi for CEXs.

Reducing sandwich attacks matters not only for user protection but also for two key reasons:

1. A trustworthy environment users can rely on
Everyone should be able to trade under transparent and fair rules, accelerating trust and adoption in DeFi.

2. Realizing free and decentralized markets, including RWAs
To open a future where real‑world assets (RWA) like stocks, real estate, gold, and bonds are handled on-chain, we need a healthy trading environment with minimal attack surface.
